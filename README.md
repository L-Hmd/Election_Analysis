# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Election employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

In addition to the above, the election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:
1. The voter turnout for each county
2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
3. The county with the highest turnout

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Election-Audit Results 
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in this congressional election.
- County Results:
    - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
    - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)

    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was: Diana DeGetter with 272,892 vote count and 73.8% of the total votes

## Election-Audit Summary:
The python script we created can be used to audit not only other congressional districts but also senatorial and local elections. We can further our analysis by breaking down the number of votes and the percentage of each candidate's total votes by county. In addition, we can determine the county with the lowest number of votes. This information will be helpful when finding ways to increase voter turnout in the next elections.
